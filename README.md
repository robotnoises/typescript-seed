# typescript-seed

Typescript is awesome, but comes with a fair amount of overhead. This is so I don't have to do that junk anymore for future projects.

Loosely based on this blog post: [Creating a TypeScript Workflow with Gulp](https://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/creating-a-typescript-workflow-with-gulp)

## Quick start

1. Clone this project: `git clone https://github.com/robotnoises/typescript-seed
2. Install TSD (global): `npm install -g tsd`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Use

1. Place all typescript files in `./src/app/*`
2. To watch for changes, run `gulp watch` in the root of your project
3. ???
4. Profit

The compiled JS and .map files will be copied to `./src/js*`
